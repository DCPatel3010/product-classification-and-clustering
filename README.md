#  Hash Index vs Linear Search on Product Classification Dataset

## Overview


This project implements and benchmarks two data search strategies:

- **Hash Index**
- **Linear Search**

The goal is to analyze their performance using different access patterns on the [UCI Product Classification Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/837/product+classification+and+clustering). The project includes performance graphs to visualize metrics such as average search time, standard deviation, and scalability with increasing search sizes.
